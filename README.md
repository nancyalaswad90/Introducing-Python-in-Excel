### If you have this feature which is currently free to use in Microsoft 365 Insiders

- You will find Python in the Insert tab in the Excel Ribbon.

- You get a few Python libraries already ready for you to use in Excel. These are the pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels and NumPy. You can import other libraries as you need using the import statement - for example import re module for REGEX calculations.

 
 
###  How can you use Python in Excel in practical terms?


I share a few ideas in the videos.

> - **From Formula --- > insert python**

You can use the pandas library and turn your data into a dataframe which you can then use for more complex tasks, like query the data, unpivot the data with python, create charts using matplotlib - make a line, area or even small multiples. You can grab URLs from long text by using the regex library. You can also use python together with Power Query. We'll only scratch the surface and even that is pretty awesome.
